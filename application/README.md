# Application Module

------

## Purpose

The **`application` module** represents the **application logic layer**. It orchestrates operations within the application and contains the **"use cases"** or **"application services"** that define the functionalities exposed by the system. This layer coordinates the interaction between domain objects and adapters.

## Responsibilities

- **Use Cases / Application Services**: Implements high-level workflows that address requirements. Each use case represents a specific functionality (e.g., "get product by ID").
- **Port Usage (Driven / Outbound)**: It uses the interfaces (ports) defined to interact with the adapters.
- **Input Validation**: Performs application-level validations on input data to ensure it's suitable for processing.
- **DTO to Domain Object Mapping**: May contain transformations of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) received from adapters into domain objects before passing them to the domain layer.

## Dependencies

This module strictly depends on the **`domain` module**. It doesn't have direct dependencies on the `adapters` module (only through the interfaces/ports defined). It also doesn't rely on infrastructure libraries like databases or web frameworks.
